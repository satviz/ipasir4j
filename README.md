# ipasir4j

ipasir4j provides a complete set of bindings to the [ipasir C interface](https://github.com/biotomas/ipasir).
For every function in the C interface, ipasir4j provides a corresponding Java function, allowing you to 
access and control incremental SAT solvers from Java without any intermediary C code.
